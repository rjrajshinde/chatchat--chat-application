# chatchat-app


This is a chat web app only for temporary purpose, like for small talk. All you gotta do is give username (not email just name or nickname whatever) and the room name (chatroom name) and hit ENTER. but if you want to join same room then you also have to type the same room name (It's case-sensitive). So give room name carefully or you will create new room with just you talking yourself. I have build the web app with the help of Youtube Channel Videos.

NOTE: Room name is case-sensitive. Type with caution!
